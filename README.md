# ICARUS DroneNet

This repository is for a subset of research related to the DroneNet project by
the ICARUS group at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, AZ. 

## Objectives

The first goal of this project is to interface to a uAvionix ADS-B receiver
which outputs ADS-B data in MAVLink packets through a USB serial port. The code
will be running on a Raspberry Pi 3 connected through USB to the ADS-B receiver. 

This goal has two steps to completion: interfacing to the ADS-B receiver and
parsing MAVLink packets to decode and make available received ADS-B traffic
data.
