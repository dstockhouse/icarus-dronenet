Lidar and Bruder test:

First test with the VN200 performed. 31 minute duration.

Test starts stationary 1 meter beneath the lidar tripod. 3D GPS fix is acquired
at approximately line 1200.

Test fixture moved to Dr. Bruder's truck at approximately line 60000, at
approximately 18 minutes into the test. He then drives around for a bit.


Bucholz:

Second test. 55 minute duration.

3D GPS fix acquired at approximately line 1200.

Test fixture attached to Jonathon's car while he drives around in view of radar
and camera. Travis flies drone in several approaches to the lidar mounted to
Jonathan's car. 

Should be able to correlate this data with Jonathan's lidar data, which was

Attached fixture to Jonathan's car during the drive from the test site back to
campus, including many bumpy roads and some highway-speed travel.
